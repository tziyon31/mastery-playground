# Git Mastery Playground

This repository is a minimal sandbox designed for mastering Git commands and workflows.

## 📚 Purpose

Practice Git tasks such as:
- Initializing repositories
- Making commits
- Working with branches and merges
- Resolving conflicts
- Using `git reset`, `revert`, `rebase`, and more

Each task can be practiced on existing files or by creating new ones inside this sandbox.

```

## 🛠 Suggested Workflow

For each Git task:
1. Create a new branch or tag it with the date.
2. Make changes relevant to the daily exercise.
3. Observe how the changes affect Git history.
4. Optionally document insights in `notes.txt`.
